# Quiz yourself on musical intervals

## Easier quiz

The Python script basic.py prompts the user with a random note (A, B, C, D, E, F or G) and a random interval (second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh) and asks "The root note is [note]. What is the [interval]?" The user must then give the note that is higher than the given note by the given interval. For example, G is a (perfect) fifth above C. The script would ask the user "The root note is C. What is the fifth?" and the user would answer "G". If the user answers correctly, the script will reply "Correct." and pose a new question of the same form. If the user answers incorrectly, the script will reply "Try again." and allow the user to answer the same question again. The user can end the quiz at any time by typing "stop".
